\definsection{Definition XX}

\begin{defin}
"Of trilateral figures, an equilateral triangle is that which has its three sides equal, an isosceles triangle that which has two of its sides alone equal, and a scalene triangle that which has its three sides unequal."
\end{defin}

Definition 20 classifies triangles based on their symmetries,

According to Definition 20:

A scalene triangle (C) has no symmetries.
An isosceles triangle (B) has bilateral symmetry.
An equilateral triangle (A) not only possesses three bilateral symmetries but also 120Â° rotational symmetries.

It's worth noting that under this definition, an equilateral triangle is not considered an isosceles triangle. However, in Euclid's Elements, the term "isosceles triangle" is introduced in $\textcolor{red}{Proposition I.5,}$ and later in $\textcolor{red}{Books II}$ and $\textcolor{red}{IV}$. The usage of "isosceles triangle" in the Elements does not exclude equilateral triangles. In modern practice, it's only necessary for at least two sides to be equal for a triangle to be classified as isosceles.

Equilateral triangles are constructed in the first proposition of the $\textcolor{red}{Elements, I.1}$. Additionally, an alternate characterization of isosceles triangles, namely that their base angles are equal, is demonstrated in $\textcolor{red}{Propositions I.5}$ and $\textcolor{red}{I.6}$.
