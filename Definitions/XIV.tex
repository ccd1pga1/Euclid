\definsection{Definition XIV}

\begin{defin}
"A figure is that which is contained by any boundary or boundaries."
\end{defin}

In Definition 14, Euclid extends his exploration beyond the simple existence of points and lines, venturing into the realm of plane figures. This definition, while succinct, encapsulates a profound understanding of geometrical spaces that has influenced countless mathematicians and philosophers throughout history.

Any combination of points, lines, or both that resides within a plane is classified as a \textbf{plane figure}. These figures are further categorized based on their constituents:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Stigmatic Figures:} Comprised entirely of points. These figures are abstract, emphasizing the concept of location without dimension.
\item \textbf{Rectilineal Figures:} Formed exclusively by straight lines, showcasing geometry’s inherent structure and boundary.
\end{itemize}

Mathematicians, such as David Hilbert\sidenote{\raggedright\ssmall{David Hilbert was a German mathematician who profoundly influenced the foundations of mathematics and geometry and is renowned for his formalization of the axiomatic system which reshaped mathematical analysis and theory.}} have emphasized the importance of Euclid’s axiomatic approach, stating that it not only laid the groundwork for geometry but also for the axiomatic method itself. Hilbert's own work, which sought to provide a more rigorous foundation for all of mathematics, mirrors Euclid’s methodological rigor, highlighting the enduring relevance of Euclidean principles.

Moreover, the classification of plane figures by Euclid offers a framework that is essential for navigating the complexity of geometric relationships. It allows mathematicians to dissect the fabric of space into comprehensible, analyzable forms.

The distinction between stigmatic and rectilineal figures, for instance, reflects a deeper philosophical inquiry into the nature of space and form, an inquiry that mathematicians like Henri Poincaré and Bernhard Riemann have further developed in their work on topology and manifold theory.

This deeper engagement with Euclid’s definitions enriches our understanding of geometry as a discipline not just of measurements and calculations, but as a philosophical and logical exploration of space itself. It reminds us that the essence of geometry, as envisioned by Euclid and elaborated upon by subsequent generations of mathematicians, lies in the fundamental relationships and properties that govern the structure of our universe.

By drawing upon the insights of respected mathematicians and integrating them with Euclid’s original work, we gain a more nuanced appreciation of the legacy and ongoing influence of "Elements" in the mathematical world. This approach not only honors the historical significance of Euclid’s contributions but also encourages a deeper, more reflective engagement with the geometrical principles that shape our understanding of space and form.
