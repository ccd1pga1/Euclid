\section{Proposition 33}

\begin{thm}
Straight lines which join the ends of equal and parallel straight lines in the same directions are themselves equal and parallel.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}

\begin{itemize}

\item[]

\item Let $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ be equal and parallel, and let the straight lines $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BD}$ join them at their ends in the same directions.
I say that $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BD}$ are also equal and parallel.

\item Join $BC$. \hfill\textcolor{red}{I.33,I.Post.1}

\item Since 
\[\overline{AB} \parallel \overline{CD}\] 
and $BC$ falls upon them, 

\item[$\therefore$] the alternate angles 
\[\angle{ABC} = \angle {BCD}\] \hfill\textcolor{red}{I.29}

\item Since 
\[\overline{AB} = \overline{CD}\] 
and $\overline{BC}$ is common, the two sides $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{BC}$ equal the two sides $\overline{DC}$ and $\overline{CB}$, and 
\[\angle{ABC} = \angle{BCD}\]

\item[$\therefore$] the base 
\[\overline{AC} = \overline{BD}\] 
the triangle 
\[\widetriangle{ABC} = \widetriangle{DCB}\] 
and the remaining angles equal the remaining angles respectively, namely those opposite the equal sides. 

\item[$\therefore$] the angle 
\[\angle{ACB} = \angle{CBD}\]\hfill\textcolor{red}{I.4}

\item Since the straight line $\overline{BC}$ falling on the two straight lines $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BD}$ makes the alternate angles equal to one another, 

\item[$\therefore$] 
\[\overline{AC} \parallel \overline{BD}\]\hfill\textcolor{red}{I.27}

And it was also proved equal to it. $\therefore$ straight lines which join the ends of equal and parallel straight lines in the same directions are themselves equal and parallel.

\end{itemize}

\end{proof}
